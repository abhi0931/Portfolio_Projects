## Overview
This project demonstrates my data cleaning, preparation, and analysis skills using Excel, developed through completing the "Excel Basics for Data Analysis" course offered by IBM on Coursera. It includes working with raw datasets to perform data cleaning and then using pivot tables for data analysis. This README accompanies four Excel files: two raw datasets and two edited datasets, showcasing the step-by-step progression from raw data to insightful analysis.

## Files Description
- `Montgomery_Fleet_Equipment_Inventory_FA_PART_1_START.csv`: The original raw dataset used for Part 1 of the final assignment.
- `Montgomery_Fleet_Equipment_Inventory_FA_PART_1_END.xlsx`: The cleaned and prepared dataset resulting from Part 1 of the final assignment.
- `Montgomery_Fleet_Equipment_Inventory_FA_PART_2_START.xlsx`: The starting point dataset for Part 2 of the final assignment, after initial cleaning.
- `Montgomery_Fleet_Equipment_Inventory_FA_PART_2_END (Analysed).xlsx`: The final dataset with pivot table analysis completed as per Part 2 of the final assignment.

## Project Tasks
### Part 1: Data Cleaning
- Converted CSV file to Excel format.
- Adjusted column widths for better visibility.
- Removed empty rows and duplicate records.
- Corrected spelling errors and removed extra whitespace.
- Consolidated department names into a single column.

### Part 2: Data Analysis with Pivot Tables
- Formatted the data as a table and used AutoSum for basic statistics.
- Created pivot tables to analyze equipment count by department.
- Sorted pivot table data and manipulated fields to analyze data from different perspectives.
- Created visualizations to analyze data visually.


## Usage and Redistribution
This project is intended for portfolio showcase purposes only. The datasets are modified versions of the public domain data from Montgomery County Government's Fleet Equipment Inventory. Please ensure any use of these files respects the original source's licensing terms and the educational context in which they were used.
